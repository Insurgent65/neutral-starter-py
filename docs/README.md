## Overview

**Neutral PWA Starter** is a modular, security-focused boilerplate for building Progressive Web Applications. It utilizes **Python (Flask)** for the backend and the **[Neutral TS](https://github.com/FranBarInstance/neutralts)**  for the frontend—a language-agnostic, logic-less templating engine.

Key features include:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Everything is isolated and modular, allowing for easy extension and overrides.
- **Declarative SQL**: Database queries are defined in JSON files, keeping the Python codebase clean and ensuring database portability.
- **Security-First Design**: Built-in CSRF protection (UTOKEN/LTOKEN), secure-by-default templating, and strict Content Security Policy (CSP) integration.
- **Modular Frontend**: Powerful snippet-based rendering system for dynamic route content.
